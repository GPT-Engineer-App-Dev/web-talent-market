# web-talent-market

Create a landing page for a marketplace called "Particles" that connects companies with software talent specializing in web technologies. Include the following:

1. A hero section with a clear value proposition explaining how Particles helps companies find top web development talent. 
2. A featured developers section showcasing 4-6 developers with their name, photo, location, and specialties (e.g. React, Node.js, .NET, Go, JavaScript). Use realistic placeholder data.
3. Testimonials from satisfied companies who have used Particles.
4. A prominent call-to-action to view the full list of developers.

Use a modern, professional design with a tech-oriented color scheme. Optimize for conversion.
